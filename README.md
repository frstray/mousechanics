# Mousechanics
## What is Mousechanics?
Mousechanics is a python toolkit for analysis of keypoint data from [DeepLabCut](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut).

## Using this Repository  
This project is in the early stages of its development, but all of the python modules currently available will perform their functions independently.

This project is being developed for Windows and Linux. Currently, the only difference in the code for each operating system is how it deals with data paths. 

Much of my code is developed in JupyterLab before I write it into python scripts. I've made these JupyterLabs available under [devlopment/jupyterlabs](https://github.com/frstray/mousechanics/tree/main/development/jupyterlabs).
